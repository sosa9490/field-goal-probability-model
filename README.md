# Field Goal Probability Model

This project was created as part of the LA Chargers Quantitative Analyst interview process. The goal is to develop a field goal success probability model using `nflfastR` and other relevant data sources, then apply that model to real football scenarios and kicker evaluation.

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/` – R scripts for data exploration, modeling, and scenario analysis
- `scripts/` – R scripts with reusable functions (e.g., data loading, model training)
- `data/raw/` – Unprocessed field goal data (e.g., pulled from nflfastR)
- `data/processed/` – Cleaned and feature-ready datasets
- `outputs/` – Model outputs, kicker rankings, and scenario recommendations
- `deliverables/` – Slide deck or summary document for review
